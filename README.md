Clarifai Car Trainer Demo
=========================

Sometimes, you really want only a specific type of car to come your way.
This is the solution of the century.
Or at least "of the day" until someone comes up with something different.

*Usage:*

Call the `positive()` and `negative()` functions, or use the cheater way by
calling `samplePositives()` and `sampleNegatives()`.  Then call `train()`.
This trains the Ferrari concept.

The submit button calls the `predict()` function, and checks if you're giving a
car that is "worthy" (as in, is it a Ferrari) or not.

*Preview:*
